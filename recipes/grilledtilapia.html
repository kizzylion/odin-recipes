        <h2>Steps for Preparing Grilled chicken</h2>
        <p>Tilapia Fish is a very popular Delicacy in West Africa. According to history and till date, Artisanal fishing in West Africa has been of major importance not for local consumption but also for job in order to make an extra source of income and livelihood. Because of the abundance of Tilapia Fish in Africa, we have derived so many ways of preparing this Fish and this varies from including frying, steaming, stir-frying, drying and even more, but grilling is a healthy and time-efficient way to prepare Tilapia.</p>

            <li><p>Remove the dirt from the fish and wash it with salt and water or lime and water and pat it dry with a paper towel then set it aside.</p></li>            
            <li><p>To make the Marinade, combine all the ingredients together in a blender and blend till it becomes a smooth paste. Pour it inside a bowl and set it aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Make about 3 deep cut or more on the fish depending on how big your fish is, then begin to brush the marinade over the fish, make sure you reach every corner baste every corner of the fish with the marinade including the deep cut.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover up the fish and place it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes or overnight. This will allow the Marinade to penetrate deep inside the Fish.</p></li>
